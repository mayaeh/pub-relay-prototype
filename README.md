pub-relay
=========

...is a service-type ActivityPub actor that will re-broadcast anything sent to it to anyone who subscribes to it.

This is a **proof-of-concept**. Due to the expected high load such a service would receive, a more performance-oriented language would be advisable.

Endpoints:

- `GET /actor`
- `POST /inbox`
- `GET /.well-known/webfinger`

Operations:

- Send a Follow activity to the inbox to subscribe
  (Object: `https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Public`)
- Send an Undo of Follow activity to the inbox to unsubscribe
  (Object of object: `https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Public`)
- Send anything else to the inbox to broadcast it
  (Supported types: `Create`, `Update`, `Delete`, `Announce`, `Undo`, `Move`)

Requirements:

- All requests must be HTTP-signed with a valid actor
- Only payloads that contain a linked-data signature will be re-broadcast
- Only payloads addressed to `https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Public` will be re-broadcast

Setting up:

- `rake db:setup` to create database
- `rake keygen` to create actor signature key

CLI interface: `bin/relayctl` for a list of commands. The relay server supports blocking domains.
